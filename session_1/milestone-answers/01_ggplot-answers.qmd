## Recreation

### Part 1: Scatterplot

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this-part-1
#| message: false
# knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone01_a.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above.

```{r}
#| label: milestone01_a

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Part 2: Scatterplot

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this-part-2
#| message: false
# knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone01_b.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above.

```{r}
#| label: milestone01_b

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(species))
```

### Part 3: Histogram

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this-part-3
#| message: false
# knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone01_c.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above (hint---it's a histogram).

```{r}
#| label: milestone01_c

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = sex)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Extension

Copy one of your plots above and paste it into the chunk below. Do some extra things to it, like changing the labels, changing the colors, adding a new geom, plotting a different variable from the dataset, change the theme, or whatever. This is your chance to play with the plot and make it as fancy as you want.

```{r}
#| label: extension

```
