## Data description 

For this milestone, you'll be exploring data about 333 penguins living across three islands in Antarctica. See [this website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) for complete details about the data and the variables included.


## Recreation

### Part 1: Scatterplot

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this-part-1
#| message: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone01_a.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above.

```{r}
#| label: recreation-part-1


```

### Part 2: Scatterplot

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this-part-2
#| message: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone01_b.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above.

```{r}
#| label: recreation-part-2


```

### Part 3: Histogram

Run the code chunk below to see a plot. Your task is to recreate this plot.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this-part-3
#| message: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone01_c.png")
```

Use `ggplot()` in the chunk below to re-create the plot above (hint---it's a histogram).

```{r}
#| label: recreation-part-3


```


## Extension

Copy one of your plots above and paste it into the chunk below. Do some extra things to it, like changing the labels, changing the colors, adding a new geom, plotting a different variable from the dataset, change the theme, or whatever. This is your chance to play with the plot and make it as fancy as you want.

```{r}
#| label: extension

```
