## Data description 

For this milestone, you'll again explore data about 333 penguins living across three islands in Antarctica. See [this website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) for complete details about the data and the variables included.


## Recreation

### Part 1

We want to see data for only Chinstrap penguins that weigh more than 4,000 grams. Run the code below to see a table. Your task is to recreate this table.

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this-part-1
#| message: false
solution_a <- readr::read_csv("data/milestone02_a.csv")
solution_a
```

Use the chunk below to re-create the table above.

```{r}
#| label: recreation-part-1


```

We want to see the average, minimum, and maximum weight (`body_mass_g`) of each penguin species. Run the code below to see a table and a plot. Your task is to recreate this table and plot

```{r}
#| label: recreate-this-part-2
#| message: false
solution_b <- readr::read_csv("data/milestone02_b.csv")
solution_b

knitr::include_graphics("images/milestone02_b.png")
```

Use the chunk below to re-create the table and plot above (*hints*: you'll want to use `group_by()` and `summarize()` when creating the data, and you'll want to use `geom_col()` to show the values in a plot).

```{r}
#| label: recreation-part-2


```


## Extension

Copy the plot above and paste it into the chunk below. Do some extra things to it, like changing the labels, changing the colors, adding a new geom, plotting a different variable from the dataset, change the theme, or whatever. This is your chance to play with the plot and make it as fancy as you want.

```{r}
#| label: extension

```
